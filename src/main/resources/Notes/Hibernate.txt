What is ORM:
Object Relational Mapping: It maps a java class variables or fields to database table columns.
To do this we need 2 annotations:
@Entity(Mandatory): When we annotate any class with @Entity , spring boot treats this class as database table.
@Id(Mandatory):  For every table we have one primary key. When we annotate any variable with @Id , then it treats as primary key of the table.
@Table : Is used to define custom name for table in db.(Optional).
@Column: Is used to define custom name for a column name in db. (Optional).
@GeneratedValue : Is used to generate unique id for primary key.

2.Step:
Create an interface extends the JpaRepository<On which Entity we are working,DataType of primary Key>

3.Step:
create service class, annotate that class as @Service.
This service class contains purely business logic.
